      "abstract": "The success of e-learning in a specific country is based on the number of computer science experts involved in the same geographic area. As a fact, the entire development of an e-learning infrastructure depends on the persons who have the expertise to create and maintain e-materials. Unfortunately, in 2006 official European statistics on education (see Eurostat 2007) showed that the interest in computer science and engineering fields of study had decreased each year, attesting to a decline in interest among K12 students for these careers, thus potentially affecting e-learning progress. This paper aims to illustrate the importance of the declining number of engineering experts in Europe and the possible consequences in the e-learning field if this decline persists. It will also identify similar consequences which have already occurred in other industrialised countries such as Canada and United States (see Computer Research Policy 2007).",

      "abstract": "Agility becomes the most significant dimension in facing the Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity (VUCA) situation. Schools as a key organisation in surviving any environment changes need to adapt and adjust. On the other hand, schools are viewed as conventional institutions. Comfortable with a traditional approach in managing the organization, schools consider as one of the latter in implementing change management. Lack of discussion and research related to agility in schools, particularly kindergarten to high school (K12) setting encourage this article to conduct a case study in one of the fastest growing schools in Indonesia namely Sekolah Murid Merdeka (SMM). This article was conducted using a qualitative method complemented with a survey as triangulation approach. The result from this research is that SMM argues to be implementing agility as a key variable in executing the operational system. Agility became a significant dimension in helping SMM adjust with the current environment and market demand thus resulted in gaining almost 10000 students in one year.",

      "abstract": "• Victor Valley College RamPage • vvcrampage@gmail.com • issuu.com/vvcrampage • vvc.edu/offices/rampage • Features pg. 4 Sports pg. 20 News pg. 2 Opinion pg. 19 The California Community Colleges Board of Governors (CCCBG) has released the results of a six year study conducted on the state’s 112 community colleges students and their students. Beginning in 2006, and through the spring of 2012, the CCCBG tracked the progress of all Victor Valley College students who enrolled at VVC in that time frame. Statistics show that only 38.6 percent of those students went on to complete either a degree or transfer outcome. Students who entered VVC after meeting UC transferable pre-requisite scores on their assessment had a 73.1 percent of obtaining a degree or transfer status. Those who scored for placement in remedial courses went on to complete their degree or transfer status 35.6 percent of the time. “I've been teaching here 12 years, and every year, my students come to freshman composition less prepared,” said English Professor Bruce Wolcott. The statistics show that many students are not prepared for the basic requirements that are needed for making the transition into college. For the students who score below requisite level, remedial courses must be taken before the student can advance to college level courses. Remedial courses do not provide acceptable UC transferrable or degree level credits. “According to the master plan of the Community Colleges Board of Governors, community colleges were designed to be open to everybody,” said Tim Johnston, Doctor of education. Easy enrollment accessibility weighs heavy on the resources of the college and due to insufficient funds, the college is unable to provide preparation tools for every person who plans to enroll at VVC. The college is initiating programs within a network of 23 participating high-schools to help prepare students for making the transition into the next level of education. The Victor Valley Student Success Committee, in partnership with the K12 Bridge program are taking steps toward improving assessment scores at the high-school level. They are initiating 'interventions' which Approximately 200 classes have been added to the summer schedule to better accommodate the student needs at Victor Valley College. The new schedule will not be posted on WebAdvisor until May 1. “With feed-back from students about the need for class, the enrollment management committee asked the Department Chairs and Deans to add to the summer schedule,” said Peter Allan, Interim Executive Vice President. With more available classes, graduating VVC students benefit from the increased courses. The incoming high school students who are looking to get ahead in college courses are also able to take advantage of the newly added classes. “The addition of these classes will allow High School students to enroll in College level classes which will count towards their High School graduation, and give them an opportunity to enroll in classes in the Fall semester,” said Allan. With the availability of classes, many students can thrive from the added courses. A large portion of students wanting to enroll in summer session were discouraged due to the lack of variety.

      "title": "AC 2012-4321: CREATING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES IN THE K12 CLASSROOM: AN INITIAL SURVEY OF THE FIELD",
      "abstract": "The recently released Framework for K-12 Science Education Standards emphasizes the importance of science and engineering practices to the K-12 classroom. This continues the stress on process and authentic activities that has characterized science education reform over at least the last two decades . It also adds the more explicit inclusion of engineering that has characterized more recent efforts. However, creating these experiences in the classroom is far from trivial. Much of the work looking at the specific structure of such inquiry-based activities at the K-12 level has consisted of either articulating intended goals or rubrics for assessing the degree of inquiry learning. This paper is intended to illuminate the means for achieving those goals and levels by generating a taxonomy of different pedagogical structures used for inquiry activities. We aim to articulate structures that are more general than individual lessons but more specific than broad goals. By systematically reviewing over 300 activities across a variety of curriculum sources, content areas and grade bands, we have validated a set of eight inquiry activity structures: Protocol, Design Challenge, Product Testing, Black Box, Discrepant Event, Intrinsic Data Space, Taxonomy, And Modeling. We further explore how particular structures are better suited to emphasizing engineering in the K12 classroom, and assess the adequacy of engineering practice exercises across subject areas and grade bands. We found the prevalence of activities that included engineering practices to lag behind the prevalence of those including science practices. However, the dominant activity structure including engineering practices – the Design Challenge – was also far better at other activity structures at promoting inquiry-based learning. Promoting inquiry-based teaching has become the central focus of reform in science education for more than two decade. That is, there is a need to move instruction from traditional teaching, where the teacher and text acts as the source of clear, unchanging information to inquiry learning, where students are active constructors of knowledge, work with data and support conclusions with empirical warrants. This was a central feature of the original National Science Education Standards . The new Framework for K-12 Science Standards continues this call, making both the importance of process and the relevance of engineering more explicit. Making this goal a reality, however, has not been easy. The interest in promoting inquiry-based teaching has certainly generated actual instances of inquiry-based instruction specific curricula and instructional plans. These have limits, though, as specific examples rather than broader concepts. In reviewing the state of inquiry as an organizing theme of science education, Anderson stresses “teachers have to be the focal point of a move towards more inquiry-oriented science education”. Our concern, therefore, lies with what conceptual resources have been provided to support teachers in enacting inquiry. At the other end of the spectrum from specific instructional plans, well articulated, abstract goals have been established. Those embedded in the various standards documents are prime examples. But these are aspirational, rather than prescriptive. Our objective is to provide teachers tools that are more general than specific activities, but more concrete that aspirational goals. As part of this goal, we aim to produce a taxonomy of the various pedagogical strategies behind creating experiences with science and engineering practices in the K-12 classroom. In this study, we have reviewed over 300 K-12 science activities from a variety of curricular resources. We have generated and validated a categorization of the structure of these lessons. In addition, by analyzing other aspects of each activity, we highlight several issues with the current state of inquiry learning in general, and engineering education specifically. Nomenclature Before proceeding further, there is an issue of nomenclature to deal with. The new Framework for Science Education does two things to improve terminology. By using the phrase “science and engineering practices” it makes clear the importance of inquiry as a reflection of what scientists and engineers do, not just inquiry as a pedagogical strategy. Second, it explicitly includes engineering, thereby stressing its importance and telegraphing that there are some differences between science and engineering. What is lacking, however, in the Standards documents and the field at large, are umbrella terms for science and engineering, and scientific inquiry and engineering design. There is no doubt that there are important distinctions, and separate terms are often needed. However, there are also important similarities, particularly in noting the difference between inquiry in a science or engineering context and inquiry in other fields such as history, art or literature. The new Framework makes this clear in that two of the eight practices distinguish between science and engineering, but six do not. At a more practical level, in K-12 education, to the extent that students are exposed to engineering, it is in the context of a class that is otherwise called “Science class”. Therefore, our use of the term “inquiry” here is intended in a broad manner. That is, it refers to the variety of investigative practices intended to expand our understanding of the natural and technological world. We mean to distinguish it from other forms of knowledge generation such as history, art or literature. Where we mean to distinguish within this category, we refer to scientific inquiry and engineering design. In our discussion of the work of others, we note their applicability to science and engineering. Likewise, when we refer to “science education”, “science class”, “science activities” etc. we are including engineering under the assumption that it is that part of the institution of K-12 education where experiences of engineering are likely to occur. Supporting Teachers in Conducting Inquiry The most obvious resources lie at the other end of the spectrum of abstraction from specific lesson plans. There are well-established articulations of what inquiry learning needs to include. Table 1 shows the essential features of classroom inquiry as delineated by the inquiry addendum to the National Science Education Standards. Essential Features of Classroom Inquiry 1) Learners are engaged by scientifically oriented questions. 2) Learners give priority to evidence, which allows them to develop and evaluate explanations that address scientifically oriented questions. 3) Learners formulate explanations from evidence to address scientifically oriented questions 4) Learners evaluate their explanations in light of alternative explanations, particularly those reflecting scientific understanding. 5) Learners communicate and justify their proposed explanations. Table 1 From Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards Though one could easily argue that these are incomplete with regard to engineering, any of these are certainly applicable to engineering. The new Framework for Science Education achieves more balanced coverage by delineating eight “science and engineering practices”, shown in Table 2 Science and Engineering Practices 1) Asking questions (for science) and defining problems (for engineering) 2) Developing and using models 3) Planning and carrying out investigations 4) Analyzing and interpreting data 5) Using mathematics and computational thinking 6) Constructing explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for engineering) 7) Engaging in argument from evidence 8) Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information Table 2 From the Framework for Science Education But these are aspirational goals: they define a target without necessarily providing guidance as to how to get there. Similarly, a number of rubrics have been developed for assessing the degree of inquiry in a given instance of instruction . Most are variants on the Herron Scale, where activities move up in levels as responsibility for conclusions, methods and questions move from teacher to student. These are applicable to both science and engineering contexts. While these can certainly play a role in guiding teacher practice through self-correction, they do not form conceptual resources for generating instruction. Level Problem Ways & Means Answers 0 Given Given Given 1 Given Given Open 2 Given Open Open 3 Open Open Open Table 3 The Herron Scale, take from Shulman and Tamir, based on Schwab and Herron Over the years there have been a number of approaches to defining inquiry for teachers, such as the Inquiry Cycle from White and colleagues or Kuhn and Pease set of ten skills. Bell and colleagues comprised a meta-list of categories used in prior frameworks. What ultimately limits these approaches is that they are not constructed from the point of view of teachers. Rather, they are based on descriptions of either what scientists do or what we want students to do. This means they retain an aspirational rather than guiding character. Consider Harwood’s description of his “activity model for scientific inquiry” as containing “10 activities in which scientists engage as often as necessary through the scientific process”. Similar to the Essential Features of Classroom Inquiry from the NSES, these often have the problem of failing to cover engineering adequately. But they also have a more basic shortcoming. Such a format tells teachers what they should get their students to do, not what teachers should do to get students to do it. Even the Herron Scale is constructed around what teachers should not do. This often instills a subtractive approach to developing inquiry: teachers plan the same underlying activity, but give less instruction. Difficulty in Inquiry Defining what teachers should do, or alternatively, the options available to them, is importan",

      "abstract": "Staff in a Kansas school district developed a survey consisting of a comprehensive set of technology integration indicators to provide data to be used in planning group and individual professional development related to the use of educational technology. Surveyed teachers rated themselves on \"where I am now\" and \"where I would like to be.\" After a pilot test, the revised survey was distributed to the district's teaching staff. Over 75% of the teaching staff responded at the first administration, and at the second administration 1,215 teachers completed the survey (90% response rate). Factor and reliability analyses indicated that the survey was a high-quality instrument that provided information that can be used to design relevant group and individual professional development and to monitor the development of teachers' technology integration skills.

With this expenditure of nearly $2400 per student, the school board and district administration wanted to enhance teachers' technology skills and to provide a system to monitor continuous improvement in technology use. Perspective A great deal of literature has expressed concern about teachers' lack of the skills needed to effectively integrate technology into the curriculum. For example, a recent survey by Market Data Retrieval (1999) found that 61 percent of teachers felt either \"not at all prepared\" or only \"somewhat prepared\" to integrate technology into classroom instruction. Further, the survey indicated that teachers with 11 or more hours of technology training were far more likely to use technology in the classroom than were teachers who received less training. Also supporting the importance of professional development to improve teachers' skills in the use of technology is research conducted in the Fairfax County Schools. White (1996) reported that students may have increased the frequency or effectiveness of their use of technology as a result of teacher training or in-class modeling by a specialist. In a recent journal article Becker (2000) also noted that \"How likely students are to experience computers in intellectually powerful ways depends greatly on their teacher's expertise with computers\" (p. 54). A report by the CEO Forum (2000) underscored the link between professional development and effective use of technology in the nation's classrooms when it stated: Well-trained teachers are the key to creating digital learning environments. Schools and districts must continue to make the commitment to professional development by providing the necessary support, resources and time for teachers to learn both how to use technology and, more importantly, how to integrate digital content and tools into the curriculum and instruction\" (p. 27). The authors would like to express their appreciation to Dr. Judy Phannensteil, president, and the staff of Research and Training Associates, Inc., Overland Park, KS for their assistance in the data analysis and reporting for this research.",

      "abstract": "The educational theory of “learning before teaching and the teaching depends on learning outcomes” gained widespread popularity among teachers and students in the growth trend of the current K12 online teaching. But there are still some problems to think about such as: what students should learn before teaching, how they learn it, the effects of class preparation and so on. It is also important to know how and what teaching methods teachers should adopt in accordance with students learning. Lexue 100 has done deep study by analyzing the above-mentioned issues and worked out its own solutions. We found that with the heuristic education, systematic exercises, seasonable rewards and answering services, each student could learn from the simple to harder ones at his own pace on Lexue 100 on-line learning platform. It also shows the improvements in students’ basic knowledge, skills in solving problems and interests of learning. Some experimental data will be provided. More importantly, the platform provided by Lexue 100 will combine teaching with learning greatly. “Internet plus Education” and the management of big data will make teaching, learning and supervision more rational, scientific, convenient and visual.",

      "title": "Addressing Teaching Practices Regarding Software Quality: Testing and Debugging in the Classroom",
      "abstract": "Software quality is seen as an integral part of CS education. Two of the key concepts concerning software quality are testing and debugging. Testing is considered important to verify the students' underlying model or algorithm. Debugging is an approach related to computational thinking which is distinct from general programming skills and fosters abilities like logical reasoning and independent problem solving. However, approaches, teaching materials, and studies on how to teach and integrate those concepts effectively into K12 classrooms are lacking. Therefore, both debugging and testing are often neglected in teaching practice, despite them being represented in many (but not all) curricula. In the following, we present a research project with the intention of providing adequate and evaluated strategies for addressing software quality in the classroom and its rationale. For this purpose, the model of Beizer's testing levels has been utilized and didactically transposed, thereby making it applicable to CS education in K12. The resulting categories may provide a basis for teaching and research.",

      "abstract": "Accepted: 7 Apr 2022 For decades, K-12 school districts have advertised their educational programming to prospective students, parents, and support networks. However, as the Internet technologies have advanced, educational institutions, including colleges and universities, have spent millions of dollars per year in online advertising leveraging Google’s search engine and data science marketing platforms. To date, no educational research has investigated the spending of K-12 school districts as to whether these educational entities have followed higher education’s lead and also purchase Google’s online advertising services to influence the educational marketplace and recruit students, parents, and support networks into the district. This study analyzes Google Adwords advertising and marketing data to evaluate 764 K-12 school districts in Texas to explore whether these school districts advertise online and how much they spend. Results suggest few K-12 school districts in Texas advertise, yet ones that do tend to be public charter schools with multiple campuses across the state. Implications for 21 century data science resources and K12 web metrics are addressed, in addition to policy and practice scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Science teachers are optimistic that every student can learn so much with high hopes and dreams. They plan their lessons and work hard to engage their students. However, despite good intentions and best laid plans, not all students perform well in Science classes. Student’s performance is very alarming on the part of the teachers. Students are unable to understand scientific issues that affect their lives in today’s fast changing world. Several studies in the past reflected that Science lessons were recorded as of low quality. (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1989). Many Science students sit passively, never being asked to make sense of the content that teachers deliver. There are many concepts and activities in Science that students ignore and fail to develop. With the Enhanced Basic Education Curriculum or the K12 curriculum, students record in periodical tests and in the National Achievement Test and National Career Assessment Test are very low and elicited poor performance. Relative to this, Bilaran Science Teachers are alarmed with the situation. Improved performance of students must be worked hand in hand by Science Teachers. Intervention programs in classes must be applied too in daily teaching engagement, thus, there is a need to strengthen the Science instruction. This study primarily focuses on the status of Science instruction and to propose a development plan in Science.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of community college students and their development of the concept of information literacy. The participants’ individual definition of information literacy was explored as well as the people, places, and events that helped shape their concept of information literacy. Data were gathered applying narrative inquiry using a combination of interviews and document analysis. It was anticipated that reflection on their prior experiences would illuminate the meaning students make of information literacy, and could help inform instruction for future students. Information literacy had different meanings to each of the participants. There was no one clear description of the term or the concept. Themes that emerged were centered on types of resources, documentation systems, and fears of plagiarism. Information literacy did not emerge as a process learned over time by these students. This study was conducted using a small sample of students (7 students) from one institution and should not be generalized to other populations. A larger study conducted nationwide is needed to gain a national perspective of information literacy development in students. Further research should be conducted to assess the experience instructors in the K12 systems as well as in community colleges systems have with learning and teaching information literacy skills. In order to affect change and proceed with the recommendation that instructors are also trained to teach these skills, there must be an understanding of the level at which instructors operate as well as standards that currently exist which support a shift to embedding information literacy into the curriculum.",

      "title": "The Role of Mentor Teachers in the National College of Education, Adaptive Cycles of Teaching (NCE ACT) and the Improvement of the NCE ACT",
      "abstract": "This paper reports research on a practice­based curriculum, the Adaptive Cycles of Teaching (ACT), supported by a cloud­based technology that enables coaching and feedback to preservice teacher candidates as they engage in classroom instruction. Specifically, the research explored mentor teachers’ perspectives on the benefits and limitations of the ACT literacy model and if mentors’ own literacy instruction practices improved through their involvement with ACT. Ten mentor teachers (grades 1­6) were interviewed. Interviews were transcribed and thematically coded to address the research questions. Findings indicated that mentors had a positive view of the ACT literacy model, and saw an impact on their students’ learning. Mentors benefited by having additional reflective opportunities, and in some cases, learning new literacy instruction practices.  Mentors identified challenges in completing all the coaching steps and working with the technology. This feedback has lead to refinements in the coaching steps and the technology coaching platform. Research Report A challenge in designing learning environments for teachers is achieving a well­coordinated balance between learning theoretical approaches to instruction, and then applying actual practical applications in the classroom. Frequently, teachers learn theory in isolation from practice, leading to difficulties in their execution in actual classrooms (Darling­Hammond, 2010). The result is that beginning teachers often struggle to put knowledge gained in preparation programs into practice (Hammerness, Darling­Hammond, Grossman, Rust & Shulman, 2005). These struggles can persist through the initial years of practice, limiting the impact beginning teachers can have on their students’ learning progress. Furthermore, preparing teachers to implement balanced literacy instruction in elementary classrooms demands a rich knowledge base that covers multiple dimensions of student learning and behavior (e.g., language development, phonics, comprehension, text structure) (Kucer, 2001). In response to this problem of practice the National Louis University, Elementary Education BA program has developed and pilot tested a practice­based approach to help teacher candidates master specific high leverage literacy practices (Ball & Forzani, 2009; Grossman, Compton, Igra, Ronfeldt, Shahan, & Williamson, 2009; Grossman Hammerness, & McDonald, 2009). Conceptual Framework Research on learning and adaptive expertise has informed the curriculum design (Darling­Hammond & Bransford, 2005). In contrast to routine experts who develop efficiency with a static set of core competencies, adaptive experts continually expand the breadth and depth of their knowledge through a willingness to explore and experiment (Hatano & Inagaki, 1986; Schwartz, Bransford, & Sears, 2005). It can be argued that adaptive expertise in teaching entails systematically learning from teaching to focus and adapt instruction to pertinent emerging demands (Hiebert, Morris, Berk, & Jansen, 2007). Adaptive expertise is facilitated through a learning environment that provides an a​ balance of stable learning structures to support efficient learning and variability to allow learners to innovate and engage in problem solving ­ an optimal corridor of adaptability (Schwartz, Bransford, & Sears, 2005; Hammerness, Darling­Hammond, & Bransford, 2005). Distinctive features in the ACT design also draw from practice­based theories, to include representations​ of practice, ​decompositions​ of practice, and ​approximations​ of practice that create consistency and predictability in how novices learn to enact core practices (Ball & Forzani, 2009; Grossman, Compton, Igra, Ronfeldt, Shahan, & Williamson, 2009; Grossman, Hammerness, & McDonald, 2009). Representations provide novices with a vision for the practice as a whole. In the ​ACT​ design, novice teachers view video models of specific teaching practices and decompose the practice using teaching performance templates to identify its critical features. Approximations of practice entail guided practice in which teacher candidates engage in repeated cycles of planning, instruction, reflection, and analysis of feedback and formative assessment data. The ACT curriculum model and supporting technologies attempt to approximate an optimal corridor of adaptability for novice teachers to ensure their trajectory toward adaptive expertise. ACT attempts to interweave stable structures that enable efficient learning with variation that allows novice teachers to adapt to different contexts and student learning demands. The model is enabled by the TREK Learning Experience Manager system, a mobile cloud­based software designed to enhance and integrate experiential learning with formal learning environments. The ACT/TREK system  provides teacher candidates with representations of core literacy practices, helps them to focus on key features of each practice, and engages them in multiple opportunities to implement them with students in classrooms. Figure 1 represents the basic reflective learning cycle for teachers implementing classroom lessons. Teacher candidates engage in multiple lesson cycles in each pedagogical content area in order to learn through and about teaching and student learning. Literacy instruction within the ACT model enables teacher candidates to gain competency in five core literacy practices: read aloud, word study, shared reading, guided reading, and writing mini lesson. Teaching feedback templates have been designed to highlight key features of each practice guide teachers through lesson planning, instruction, video analysis, and analysis of student learning. By gaining proficiency in these practices, teacher candidates are prepared to design and implement balanced literacy in their future classrooms. The NCE Adaptive Cycles of Teaching provides a framework for cycles of learning to implement these core literacy practices using the model depicted in Figure 2. To date, the curriculum design efforts have focused on the learning needs of NLU teacher candidates. Anecdotal feedback from principals and mentors have suggested that mentor teachers can benefit from the explicit structure of the ACT model to improve the quality of their balanced literacy instruction. More field research is needed to understand how classroom based mentors perceive the ACT curriculum and the supporting software design and its possible impact on K­12 student learning. Research Questions 1. How do mentors view the benefits and limitations of the ACT model for supporting professional growth of teachers in their initial years of practice? 2. Did changes occur in the mentor teacher classrooms as a result of their involvement in the ACT model? If so, in what ways? Method Context The Adaptive Cycles of Teaching is the core curriculum for the BA Elementary Education undergraduate program in the National College of Education of National Louis University. During their senior year, teacher candidates in the program complete a series of methods courses (i.e., literacy, math, science, and social studies) and field seminars while engaged two days a week in classroom field placements. The ACT framework supports the field learning experiences, methods courses, and seminar to bring coherence.  In the final quarter of the senior year, teacher candidates complete their student teaching. Participants Ten mentor teachers who had worked with teacher candidates in their classrooms participated in the study.  Four of the teachers were in grades K­2; six of the teachers were in grades 3­5 Four of the mentor teachers taught in urban settings, six taught in suburban settings.  The majority of the mentors had been teaching for 5 years or more in their settings. Data Sources and Analysis The data sources were derived from interviews with the mentor teachers. Each interview lasted approximately 45 to 60 minutes. The interviews were recorded and transcribed for the analysis. Transcripts were reviewed for common themes across the interviews. Themes are represented in the findings. Findings The mentor teacher interviews highlighted several considerations for the ACT practice­centered curriculum model of teacher preparation. The first finding regarded the relative match of the five core literacy practices as defined in the ACT model with the mentor teacher practices at receiving sites. In some cases they were well aligned, in others, less so.  When practices were aligned, the teacher candidates quickly integrated into the activity flow and how students were learning.  Two mentors observed: You know the same components that we use in lessons at XXX School, she knows, like she already came in with in her toolbox and the kids react to. She came in doing many things that the school was doing with their curriculum. It was a nice transition for the kids. Even when practices were well aligned, some logistical challenge remained regarding the teacher candidates field site days and the classroom schedules. The days teacher candidates were present in schools was not always the same day and time that a core practice was planned.  Hence, in addition to examining the specifics of the core practices, daily and weekly class schedules need to be considered in designing a practice­centered curriculum. There are implications for the days in which teacher candidates attend placement sites. A second important finding was the shared learning that occurred between the teacher candidates and their mentors.  In some instances, mentor teachers were learning how to implement the core practice for the first time and this presented a learning opportunity for them. One teacher articulated this by saying they were “learning together.”  Another mentor observed that the teacher candidate “was reading Daily Five– It was new to me and we shared learning about this together.” Instances where mentor teachers appropriated the ACT core practices into their own repertoire were partic",

      "abstract": "Summary) The independent research institute, SRI International at Stanford University, recently released the final results of a two year study, which was the \"first objective, large-scale study of the use of handheld computers\" (SRI International, 2002, ¶1) involving 102 elementary and secondary classrooms in which teachers had received Palm Education Pioneer (PEP) technology grants. Copyright Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education 2007 [Headnote] The classroom computer is no longer confined to a box on the desk. Mobile handheld computing devices have evolved into powerful and affordable learning tools. Handheld technologies are changing the way people access and work with information. The use of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs or handhelds) has been an evolving part of the business world for more than 15 years and the implementation of these devices in higher education has often followed that business model. This article will provide research findings from a case study concerning the use of PDAs to support the integration of technology into a Teacher Education program at a midwestern university's College of Education. The classroom computer is no longer confined to a box on the desk. Mobile handheld computing devices have evolved into powerful and affordable learning tools. These devices are becoming smaller, cheaper, more reliable, and more connected. Educators and students need to begin to identify the advantages of these emerging technologies for enhancing lifelong learning. The small size and versatility of personal digital assistants (PDA) such as the Palm® (see trademark notice at the end of the article), HP iPAQ® and others beg the question: Can this small device provide the pedagogical and technological support in the classroom for research and teaching in similar ways as the desktop computers in higher education? Although the handheld has found increasing use in K12 settings and undergraduate nursing, medical, and law schools across the country, limited application into the humanities, social sciences, and education has been made in higher education (PalmOne Education Solutions, n.d.a, Jl). Handheld computers were first introduced as the electronic version of the daily planner. The first handhelds arrived with schedule, address, and task list software. Today the handheld is seen as a \"universal-access devices, able to ferret out essential information wherever it happens to be stored-on the desktop PC, the home-office server or the Internet\" (Frauenfelder, 1999, Jl ). Many companies are examining ways in which handheld computers can be used with the Internet and are \"repackaging\" software to maximize the smaller screens and memory. Other developers are concentrating on making these small devices exchange information between desktop computers, servers, and other handhelds. Telecommunication companies are creating wireless digital networks and integration with cell phones and handhelds to provide greater mobility and increased communications between the office, home, and field (Frauenfelder). While at first the handheld was used mostly by upper management and mathematicians for number crunching, the handheld of today is carried by business people, housewives, and school children. Handhelds have become less expensive than some scientific calculators with a greater capacity to compute, store, and retrieve information. The use of the handheld has also changed, as the handheld can now successfully navigate the three major functions of word processing, spreadsheets, and databases, which are standard applications of desktop computers in the home and school. Development continues to produce more powerful software for the integration of graphics and video with the newest stage of handheld development supporting access to e-mail and the Internet to make communication universal. Handheld technology provides a way to extend the use of desktop computers to field Page 1 of 10 Document View ProQuest 6/22/2011 http://wf2dnvr2.webfeat.org/iUHZQ14121/url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?vinst=PR... environments in which a smaller, mobile technology can be used to collect data and content to be returned and further expanded through the desktop computer. To date, much of the research surrounding handhelds comes to us from K-12 settings. The independent research institute, SRI International at Stanford University, recently released the final results of a two year study, which was the \"first objective, large-scale study of the use of handheld computers\" (SRI International, 2002, ¶1) involving 102 elementary and secondary classrooms in which teachers had received Palm Education Pioneer (PEP) technology grants. Schools which participated in PEP were selected through a rigorous competitive grant process in which teachers proposed how they would implement the use of the handheld during an entire school year. Teachers participating in PEP grants implemented handheld technology during the 2001-2002 school years (SRI International). Dr. Barbara Means, director of SRI's Center for Technology in Learning states, \"Schools that have adopted handhelds to date have done so without the benefit of research to guide them. Now, through the results of the PEP program study, teachers and schools can make informed decisions about adopting and implementing handhelds. Twenty-five (25) years of research on desktop computers has shown that, when used appropriately, technology can have a beneficial impact on teaching and learning\" (Vahey & Crawford, 2002). Findings from the SRI International PEP Final Evaluation Report indicate that teachers and students participating had a high acceptance of handhelds in the classroom. The teachers were enthusiastic about the support to teaching and learning handhelds had to offer. SRI reported the following key findings: * 89% said of the teachers found the handhelds to be an effective instructional tool for teachers; * 93% of the teachers believe that handhelds can have a positive impact on students' learning; * 95% of the teachers said their students were \"very\" (66%) or \"fairly\" (29%) comfortable using the handhelds; * 90% of the teachers plan to continue using handhelds in the classroom post-study; and * 72% of the teachers said handhelds are more easily used in the \"flow of classroom activity\" than desktop computers (Vahey & Crawford, 2002). The Palm Education Pioneers Program Final Report (2002) stated that: PEP teachers were overwhelmingly positive about the use of handheld computers in their classrooms. Approximately 90% of PEP teachers stated that handhelds are an effective instructional tool; that handhelds have the potential to have a positive impact on students' learning; and that they will continue to use handhelds in the future. Although teachers across all grade levels were positive about the use of handheld computers in their classroom, elementary school teachers were more positive than middle and high school teachers. Teachers who used handhelds for science-based curricula or for writing-based activities found handhelds most effective, although handhelds were found to improve learning activities across many curricular topics and instructional activities, (p. 6) The use of handhelds in higher education has been demonstrated most often in the areas of nursing, medicine, and law. Columbia University's School of Nursing is using handhelds to reduce the risk of medical errors and to help advance evidence-based medical care. Columbia University provided to its Entry-to-Practice students a handheld to use when interacting with patients. The handheld are being used to allow students to capture data during care of the patient. There are no notes to transcribe or handwriting to interpret and the handheld provides a common language for data collection allowing the data to be aggregated for decision-making (PalmOne Education Solutions, n.d.a, ¶1). Columbia faculty are working with the Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning to develop a program based on the Home Health Care Classification (HHCC), which provided a consistent classification and reference for nursing. Supervision of nursing students can also be supported during this process. By creating such a database, the students can provide the safest, most evidence-based care as well as document their nursing assessments, interventions, and outcomes. Dr. John Kues, Assistant Dean for Continuing Medical Education and professor of Family Medicine at the University of Cincinnati, suggests that the body of knowledge in modern medicine is constantly changing and that the ability to memorize the endless drug interactions is nearly impossible. He believes that the usefulness of PDAs is as a portable knowledge repository. Resident physicians (new doctors continuing in specialty training) need current information to make decisions. The large repository of medical information that can be stored on a Palm provides a foundation for decision-making by new doctors with limited clinical experience, knowledge, and background. When the resident leaves the hospital at the end of his/her shift, it is easy to sync the information about a patient case and Page 2 of 10 Document View ProQuest 6/22/2011 http://wf2dnvr2.webfeat.org/iUHZQ14121/url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?vinst=PR... may this information available to the next group of resident doctors thus improving communication concerning patient care (Campus Technology from the Syllabus Media Group, 2004). Carolyn Eady, a medical student in her third year at the University of Cincinnati, uses drug interaction software called ePocrates Rx Pro and First Consult, an online clinical information system. She states that the programs \"definitely save you time and effort. As I am seeing a patient, I can be looking up what I need to let them know to keep themselves healthy and what drugs I need to start writing prescriptions for.. .My Palm's much lighter than carrying four different books around\" (Ca",

      "abstract": "This workshop will be a hands-on introduction to “Creative Circuitry.” Participants will learn about craft and art projects which incorporate electrical circuits. Special emphasis will be placed on using these projects and methods in programs for children from diverse backgrounds and abilities. We will discuss techniques and strategies for incorporating Creative Circuitry into a variety of different educational contexts. The session will also include an introduction to basic electronics and circuit components. Workshop Description. This workshop explores “Creative Circuitry,” which we define as teaching elementary electrical circuit design and construction through projects where technology is embedded in craft. The presenters of this workshop, and their colleagues, have led Creative Circuitry explorations in a wide variety of settings for audiences ranging from PK-elementary classrooms, summer workshops for girls, library based drop-in sessions for teens and families, and an after-school program for Deaf students. The learning objectives of this workshop are:  Technical Knowledge: Participants will learn the basics of electrical circuits and how to design/build them.  Pedagogical Discussion: The effectiveness of using artistic projects to introduce circuits to children will be discussed. Particular emphasis will be given to the role e-textiles and creative circuitry can play in engaging students who are not typically well represented in STEM programs.  Implementation: Participants will brainstorm and discuss ways to incorporate creative circuitry into their own educational settings. P ge 1.5.3 WORKSHOP PROPOSAL FORM 2015 Annual ASEE K-12 Workshop on Engineering Education “Authentic Engineering: Representing & Emphasizing the E in STEM” Presented by Dassault Systems Saturday, June 13, 2015 8:00 A.M. – 5:00 P.M. Sheraton Seattle | Seattle | WA CreatCirc2015-ASEE-K12-Proposa.docx Page 3 of 6 The session will begin with an explanation of a variety of Creative Circuitry projects, and an overview of the research literature on this topic, particularly as it applies to K-12 student learning. The hands-on component of the workshop will be focused on building Squishy Circuits. Through this activity we will discuss open and closed circuits, the differences between conductors and insulators, and basic circuit components (such as LEDs, resistors, and motors). The explanation will include both the technical terminology as well as some analogies that our research group has found useful when explaining the circuits to younger children. There will then be a short demonstration of how these components work with the dough. Participants will be encouraged to play with the conductive and insulating dough to make a variety of circuits that use LEDs, buzzers, and motors. The workshop leaders will spend time with the participants answering questions, problem solving, and discussing common struggles their students might have. The participants will be given the recipes for the conductive and insulating dough, instructive notes that explain short circuits, conductors and insulators, LEDs, and open and closed circuits, and the link to the Squishy Circuit site to help further the exploration of these components. Additionally, participants will receive handouts with additional Creative Circuitry project ideas and strategies for reducing supply costs.",

      "title": "Board 82: Visual Literacy in Mechanical Engineering Design: A Practical Approach to Assessment and Methods to Enhance Instruction",
      "abstract": "This work-in-progress seeks to benchmark the visual literacy skills of undergraduate mechanical engineering students at a small technical university, as well as the faculty’s current efforts to develop students’ visual literacy skills. Visual literacy is accepted as a crucial 21st century skill for students, professionals, and citizens, yet its definition varies greatly across the literature. Existing assessment tools are too general and are insufficient for measuring visual literacy as it applies to engineering design. Our work seeks to establish a simplified method for assessing the visual literacy skills of graduating seniors in a mechanical engineering program. This work will inform the practical next steps in improving visual literacy pedagogy within the program in ways that are sustainable and effective for both faculty and students. We report on the methods of reviewing student visual literacy skills through an examination of a sample of capstone reports completed by the undergraduate mechanical engineering students in the class of 2017 in order to provide a baseline assessment of visual literacy skills. In addition, we report on survey results from faculty respondents regarding the importance they place on visual literacy within their instruction and in assessing students, what tools and methodologies faculty are currently employing, and explore what resources faculty would be most likely to utilize for enhancing instruction within this area. It is expected that in future work strategies and tools will be identified that could be adapted for use at other institutions and programs for assessing visual literacy in STEM fields. Future expansion of this work will include assessment of a larger sample of mechanical engineering student work, as well as other STEM programs at the university in order to measure student growth in visual literacy skills over the duration of their undergraduate experiences. Pilot studies involving faculty training in enhanced pedagogical strategies will also be developed in future work based on the outcomes of this work-in-progress. Communication Skills in Engineering Education In a 2006 study conducted by researchers at Penn State on behalf of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), 98% of employers surveyed ranked effective communication as moderately important, highly important or essential, the highest ranked of all eleven ABET learning outcomes. However, only 75% of these employers reported that new engineering graduates were adequately or well prepared in terms of communication skills [1]. The current ABET General Criterion 3, outcome (g) states that students must demonstrate “an ability to communicate effectively”, but there is no mention of distinctions between written, oral or visual communication skills [2]. In contrast, outcome (f) for engineering technology programs requires “an ability to apply written, oral, and graphical communication in both technical and non-technical environments; and an ability to identify and use appropriate technical literature” [2]. This trend is also evident in the literature for general higher education standards. The 2002 report published by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) stated the need for learners to “effectively communicate orally, visually, in writing, and in a second language” [3]. However, in the AAC&U’s follow-up report in 2005 omitted the direct reference to visual literacy and instead included the broader quantitative and information literacies [4]. In response to major changes in accreditation outcomes in the late 1990s (a.k.a. ABET 2000), many engineering schools began programs to integrate writing into their technical courses. “Writing across the Curriculum” replaced or supplemented technical communications courses. Engineering faculty were reluctant to participate, as they felt ill-prepared to teach writing, and felt that writing instruction would take time away from important technical content [5]. With no specific requirement for graphical communications in the new ABET accreditation requirements and pressure to address other criteria, graphical communication courses fell by the wayside at many universities. Defining Visual Literacy Definitions of visual literacy vary widely within the literature, particularly due to contextual basis. Scholars in visual literacy have often selected specific components of different disciplines that support their own theories and definitions, which has contributed to the lack of a single coherent theory for visual literacy [6]. This lack of coherent theory, and thus an agreed upon definition, for visual literacy impacts research; forming a consistently accepted definition would help to advance research within the field [6] – [8]. However, it is widely accepted that traditional definitions of literacy that focus solely on the reading and writing of text-based media are now insufficient [4], [8] – [10]. John Debes, as a founding member of the International Visual Literacy Association, stated that visual literacy “refers to a group of vision-competencies a human being can develop by seeing and at the same time having and integrating other sensory experiences” [11]. Debes suggests that use of these vision-competencies allow a visually literate person to discriminate and interpret visuals he or she encounters, communicate with others, and comprehend and enjoy masterworks of visual communication [11]. While this definition helped to begin the discussion around the importance of visual literacy skills, technological innovations and the importance of visual media in contemporary culture are causing rapid shifts in how visual literacy is defined. New definitions place emphasis on the use of visual media as a communication tool within a digital, connected world, as well as the ability to both critically analyze and produce visual materials. Metros [12] distilled visual literacy down into the ability to derive meaning from visual media and to compose effective visual communications. Larry Johnson [13] comments that visually literate people “have an imaginative ability to see and understand the messages communicated with images, as well as to create, modifying, and use visual cues and images”. As Peter Felten [14] states, “the process of becoming visually literate continues through a lifetime of learning new and more sophisticated ways to produce, analyze, and use images”. Brumberger [15] further highlights the importance of production of visual media in defining visual literacy, stating, “the ability to analyze and interpret images and other visual material, although critical, is not by itself sufficient for full visual literacy; it must be accompanied by some ability to create visual material”. Despite emergent themes, the absence of an agreed-upon definition for visual literacy is prevalent. This may be influenced in part by the inclusion of visual literacy as part of a larger multimodal literacy that addresses the competencies needed in the 21st century. There is much overlap between visual literacy and other areas, such as digital technology and digital literacy [16]. Information literacy has also been used as a means for encompassing skills related to visual literacy [8], [16]. Learning Standards for the Digital Age Learning standards that define skills and competencies for the digital age, particularly in the K12 sector, have been emerging in recent years and state the need for skill development beyond traditional textual literacy [16]. Many of these standards describe skills related to visual literacy, though others are more implicit in their descriptions. For example, the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) published the Standards for the 21st Century Learner, which include skills such as, “use the writing process, media, and visual literacy, and technology skills to create products that express new understandings” [17]. The enGauge 21st Century Skills also explicitly mentions visual literacy skills [18]. Others, such as the Partnership for 21st Century Learning, implicitly address visual literacy by including it under a larger umbrella of digital or information literacy [19]. One such standard states, “articulate thoughts and ideas effectively using oral, written, and nonverbal communication skills in a variety of forms and contexts” [19]. This highlights the importance of using visual representations without acknowledging visual literacy as a discrete set of skills, while also further highlighting the lack of a cohesive and accepted definition for visual literacy. Higher education specific standards explicitly containing visual literacy skills are limited. The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) published the Visual Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (henceforth referred to as the Visual Literacy Standards), which were informed by the ACRL’s prior work in defining the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education [16]. The Visual Literacy Standards address the need for higher education students to develop skills in visual literacy and promote that “a visually literate individual is both a critical consumer of visual media and a competent contributor to a body of shared knowledge and culture” [20]. The Visual Literacy Standards provide a framework for teaching visual literacy skills from an information literacy perspective and highlight the expanding role of librarians and educators in supporting student development in digital age literacy skills. There is much overlap between information literacy and visual literacy as the evaluation and use of visual information has grown within research processes [8]. However, the Visual Literacy Standards allow for more specific focus on skills necessary for evaluating, analyzing, using, and producing visual materials. While much has been published on defining visual literacy and its perceived influence on the development of crucial 21st ce",

      "title": "The Future of School Bands: Wind Ensemble Paradigm",
      "abstract": "Introduction American school bands are a unique tradition not found universally around the globei and have contributed positively to the lives of millions of young Americans. Current educational priorities, however, are making it difficult for students to schedule band as traditionally conceived. The purpose of this article is to explore whether the school band, as historically conceived, meets the needs of our current and future students and society; and if and how it can continue to be a staple of school music departments. I will treat this topic as a professional concerned with the music education of children and what is best for our society at large, not as a member of the band tradition dedicated to maintaining the status quo absent critical examination. If the school band can stand critical scrutiny, it should continue. If it can't, it shouldn't: plain and simple. As a profession we love exercises like this. We have piles of papers from colloquia discussing the future of music education that are filled with wonderful ideas. But, unfortunately, we have changed very little since the early 20th Century when we developed our current specialized music offerings. Instead of transforming music education to meet society's changing needs since the mid-ZOth Century, we have largely added new components to our existing offerings and advocated for maintenance of the status quo.2 That has been our modus operandi since music entered the school curricula in the 19* Century: always-adding more, never truly transforming, and always advocating for assumed benefits of music instruction in school without providing evidence that they actually exist. MENC's advocating questionable research and joining with the music industry in commercial campaigns only serves to cheapen us professionally. This low level of professional discourse does not serve us well in the current edu-political environment with MBA-educated school board members and administrators and a more educated and savvy general public. Education is serious business and we need to be serious professionals who offer curricula that serve real needs of students and communities. It is important to remember that K12 schools are social institutions that serve the needs of society. There are many stakeholders who influence curriculum such as government, industry, and special interest groups. Curricular changes are not made in isolation from the greater society. Therefore, it is first necessary to understand the context for which school bands were designed in order to determine if they still meet the needs of today's society. Knowing the context surrounding their development will provide us with something to compare with today's context. This will help keep our discussion focused on education as a service to society rather than an entity unto itself. Therefore, I will begin with a historical review of how bands were brought into the school curriculum, proceed with an analysis of today's context, and conclude with implications and recommendations for developing a new kind of school band built on the wind ensemble paradigm. Factors Contributing to the Development of School Bands Although there were some isolated school bands prior to World War I, the war's end marked the beginning of the modern era and growth of school bands.3 This was a unique moment in history that included societal and educational environments for which school bands as traditionally conceived were a perfect match. Jere Humphreys, writing for the Ithaca College centennial celebration in 1992, identified two primary factors that supported the introduction of instrumental music into schools: 1) its popularity in society and 2) sweeping social and educational changes. To these he added two additional factors responsible for the evolution of instrumental music education: the music industry and the music and music education professions.* Societally, urbanization, industrialization, massive immigration, and child labor laws provided a growing population base for K12 schools, which caused them to expand in scope and number. …",

      "abstract": "The University of Maine's Aerospace Science and Technology in Secondary Schools (ASTSS) program aims to develop innovative pathways into STEM and specifically into Aerospace Engineering. In this context, a pilot project with Bangor High School (BHS) was initiated that uses Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) to engage high school students in citizen-science activities that are of direct relevance to their local community. In order to safely conduct these activities, the ASTSS project provides support at two levels. The first is UAS operation-focused, and includes developing training elements that can be used by teachers and mentors to introduce elements such as basic UAS technology, regulatory framework, mission planning, and mission execution. The aim here is to support recreational flyers in achieving FAA TRUST certification and to safely operate their UAS. The second element is the definition of community science projects that leverage UAS for the collection of data. A catalog of suitable projects is being developed by university earth science researchers that can be adapted to different high school environments and locations. These projects include studies on coastal erosion, geology, geomorphology, agriculture and forestry, snow coverage, and water quality. For this pilot project students from Bangor High School (BHS) are conducting water quality sampling and testing in Maine's Taunton Bay, an estuary in Hancock County. In a number of extracurricular field trips, students collect water samples using drones. These samples then undergo standard water chemistry analyses, as well as Pre and Polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) contamination research which has become a significant public issue in the state of Maine. To date, the project has not only been adopted in extracurricular club activities, but also in an increasing number of curricular elements, with the participation of thirteen BHS students and three UMaine undergraduates. The goals of the project consist of increasing high school student participation in STEM activities that are of direct societal relevance, and to introduce UAS as vehicles to expose students to aerospace technology and related career paths.",

The idea that there are different kinds of rationalities appears slowly to be recognized even in the pre-schooling context of Kindergartens. If there are different paradigms of rationality, children with deviating intellectual behaviors have to be accepted and it is the duty of a teacher to find out what kind of deviation the child is developing. Deviation is not necessarily a symptom of mental disorder. It just might signalize a mismatch between the child's unconscious and the teachers conscious paradigm of math. The Leibniz approach is focusing on the identity of objects. The Brownian on the possibilities of partitioning a set of elements. The Mersennian on the possibilities of differentiations of the objects of a multi-set. While the Stirlingian deals with differences of elements of a pattern. All four approaches are forcing different kinds of arithmetical and logical thinking. (work in progress, vers. 0.3.5, Oct. 2013) 1. Kindergarten math: numbers and counting 1.1. How it starts What are the aims of a standard western Kindergarten education in such abstract disciplines like math, geometry and counting? The answer is easy found. Simply check the offers of one of the many educational organizations and supporting industries. They all guarantee the parents a steep learning curve for their children to learn to master the basics of the adult mind set of math. There is not a single offer that is taking the capacities of children seriously and offers strategies to develop genuine infant-adequate education. One of the many successful companies is the company “Home Schooling for Kids” which offers “KS3, A-Levels, GCSE & IGCSE Courses From £350\". http://www.OxfordHomeSchooling.co.uk What’s on offer on the ‘Sure Start’ market? \"The goal of kindergarten math curriculum is to prepare children for first grade math. Please see below a list of objectives and goals for kindergarten math: \"The goal of kindergarten math curriculum is to prepare children for first grade math. Please see below a list of objectives and goals for kindergarten math: To count by rote at least to 20, but preferably a little beyond. The concepts of equality, more, and less. To count backwards from 10 to 0. To recognize numbers. To be able to write numbers. To recognize basic shapes. To understand up, down, under, near, on the side, etc. (basic directions). To have a very basic idea of addition and subtraction. It also helps to expose the student to two-digit numbers. \"Children may also get started with money, time, and measuring, though it is not absolutely necessary to master any of that. The teacher should keep it playful, supply measuring cups, scales, clocks, and coins to have around, and answer questions.\" http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/kindergarten.php It is also important to know that the definition of a rational human being is implying the skills of those math topics added with the ability to draw some logical conclusions, say with modus ponens. All that is instructed in the social context of a governmental schooling program that is confusing learning and training with education. Failing such skills of adult cognition excludes the person to be qualified as a rational human being (homo sapiens). Without surprise there is some resistance to the schooling movement. \"I suppose it is because nearly all children go to school nowadays, and have things arranged for them, that they seem so forlornly unable to produce their own ideas.” Agatha Christie http://studentliberation.com/quotes_1.html In this paper, I will not deal with the many approaches of the anti-schooling movements but with the very essentials of conceptual thinking that are accepted by both sides, the schooling and the anti-schooling institutions and movements. 1.2. Some background theories for the traditional approach Principles postulated in the tradition of the Piaget school The abstraction principle \"The realization of what is counted is reflected in this principle. A child should realize that counting could be applied to heterogeneous items like toys of different kinds, color, or shape and demonstrate skills of counting even actions or sounds! There are indications that many 2 or 3 year olds can count mixed sets of objects. 2 Author Name",

      "title": "A Study of Classifying Style of Teachers a State of Students' Learning based on K12 Online Education",
      "abstract": "In recent years, online education has been advancing significantly. However there is a major challenge how to evaluate style of teachers and state of student learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines speaker diarization, speaker recognition, feature selection to classify style of teachers and state of students learning based on audio data. We train speaker recognition model and learn embedding vector of teachers or students on online platform. We select 25 acoustic features and statistical features from audio recordings and train classification model to classify style of teachers and state of students’ learning jointly. Experimental results show that the task of classifying style of teachers achieves 71.25% precision and precision of classifying state of students’ learning is 83.71%. Introduction With the advent of Internet online education has broadly developed and emerged many famous organizations such as Khan academic, MOOC etc. Compared to traditional education, online education has the advantage of implementing personal education. Using internet and video technology, online education allows face to face communication virtually between teacher and student and improves efficiency However, a huge challenge online education faces is how to evaluate style of teacher or to evaluate state of students learning. The principle goal of online education, especially K12 stage, is to improve students’ performance. Audio recording contains rich information and receives a lot attention. Recent many recent research focus on modeling teachers from audio recording or speech. Online education platform collects a lot of audio recordings and video recordings. However, as our knowledge , there is not any research on classifying style of teachers or state of students’ learning based on audio recordings. With exponential growth of computer power and data volume and algorithm breakthrough, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in many fields [1]. In some fields, system performances such as speaker recognition[2],speech recognition[3] approach to human performance or amount to human level. Due to deep learning technology, deep speaker model achieves state of the art in speaker identification. Exploiting deep learning model achieves more accuracy of speaker identification and precision of segmenting between teacher and student. In this work, we use convolutional neural network framework to train speaker identification model based on open source data set LibriSpeech [4]and ST-CMDS-20170001_1. Similar to framework in [5],but output dimension size in our model shrinkages to 256, reducing number of parameter. Using trained speaker identification model, we learn embedding vector of teacher or student according to their audio utterance in our platform and produced feature dataset of teacher or student. We process audio recordings and segment into audio segments and extract 25 interactive features. we take 25 features as input to train two classification model jointly: one is to classify style of teachers, another to classify state of the student learning. 6 Copyright © 2018, the Authors.

      "title": "Modeling Advanced Oxidation Processes for Water Treatment",
      "abstract": "• Many conventional wastewater treatment processes only partially remove trace organics that result from human use, including hormones and pharmaceuticals. • Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can be used to remove the chemicals that remain. Ultraviolet Photolysis of H2O2 (UV/H2O2) is one of the most common AOPs used in practice. • In this work, we propose a kinetic model to simulate the UV/H2O2 process taking into account the destruction of trace organics by radicals generated in multiple reactions. • This research predicts the degradation of organic contaminants over a wide range of conditions and illustrates the potential for polishing conventionally treated wastewater with AOPs. • To oxidize unwanted compounds remaining in wastewater. • To characterize the mechanism and kinetics behind the decomposition of nonylphenol (NP) and p-cresol (PC), two chemicals in wastewater that serve as surrogates for endocrine disruptors. • To improve an already robust UV/H2O2 AOP model by taking into account spatial variations of radical concentrations. • To predict the degradation of organic contaminants over a wide range of conditions, thus broadening the model’s applications. Preliminary model results demonstrate that the UV/H2O2 model was successful in reproducing previously published results (Figure 6). • Typical wastewater treatment processes do not completely remove organics, such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupters. • An advanced treatment method which removes these unwanted chemicals in a cost-efficient manner is highly desirable. • This research simulates and analyzes a UV/H2O2 AOP, which converts organic contaminants into carbon dioxide (CO2), instead of transporting the contaminants across different treatment phases, such as in adsorption processes. • This project applies an innovative approach to the UV/H2O2 model, taking into account spatial variations of radical concentrations in the reactor. • By improving an already robust UV/H2O2 AOP model, there is obvious potential for polishing conventionally treated wastewater. INTRODUCTION UV/H2O2 MODEL OBJECTIVES METHODOLOGY CHEMICAL REACTIONS ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS RESULTS Figure 1: Student conducting UV/H2O2 AOP experiments. I would like to thank: • Dr. Maria Teresa Velez, the Director of the University of Arizona Undergraduate Research Opportunities Consortium (UROC) • Donna Treloar, the Director of the University of Arizona Summer Research Institute (SRI) This research was supported by the Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO) ‘Senior Alliance’ Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) National Science Foundation (NSF). Figure 2: This one-reactor setup assumes uniformity of all chemical concentrations. Figure 3: This two-reactor setup considers each reactor1 and reactor2 as separate reactors and assumes uniformity of all chemical concentrations in each reactor. CONCLUSIONS • The adjusted UV/H2O2 models, which take into account the spatial variations of radical concentrations, are improved models. • Expanding this multiple-reactor approach to other data sets and different conditions would be rewarding future research. • As originally hypothesized, the degradation of organic contaminants is predictable over a wide range of conditions. • This UV/H2O2 model illustrates the promise for effectively and efficiently removing potentially harmful contaminants in water. • The implications of these results are significant. • Determining a consistently successful and cost-effective method for the removal of these pollutants is essential.

Kinetic and equilibrium constants are at 25°C. Reactions E1 to E4 are considered to equilibrate instantaneously. Learning the Model: • In order to validate the efficacy of the UV/H2O2 model, data from previously published research were successfully reproduced. • Accurate comparisons between these graphs and those previously developed demonstrate an understanding of the model. Fixing the Model: • Originally, the UV/H2O2 model functioned as one reactor (Figure 2), in which the concentrations of the radicals are assumed to be uniform throughout the reactor. This assumption of uniformity throughout the reactor is inaccurate. • We adjusted the model by dividing the reactor into multiple equivalent sections (Figures 3 and 4). • By considering two or three individual reactors, the model better accounts for light intensity effects and spatial variations of radical concentrations. • Comparisons between the one-reactor setup, the two-reactor setup, and the three-reactor setup allow for insight as to how depth influences the chemical degradations. The new multiple-reactor approaches take into account spatial variations of radical concentrations. The figure below (Figure 7) demonstrates slight improvement in the accuracy of the multiple-reactor models compared to the original single-reactor model.",

      "abstract": "The role of human-computer interaction in school lessons is usually limited, if at all, to the usability factor of applications. In this paper, we report on a set of teaching principles and a project in which students between the ages of 15 and 18 playfully work through 3D, Virtual Reality, and usability issues without any particular prior knowledge in this field. In this work, we show that the suggested approach is founded on general didactic principles. Furthermore, by following neurodidactic findings, it is highly appealing to students, and essential computing science skills can be taught quasi incidentally. By systematically mapping our setting and decisions to teaching principles, we also show that HCI is not only one topic to be taught – it becomes a valuable didactic tool.",

      "title": "Using Drawings to Understand Impacts of Soft Robotics Activity on Elementary Age Students’ Perceptions of Robots",
      "abstract": "This Innovative Practice article aims to address the gender disparities that persist across traditional engineering disciplines including mechanical and electrical engineering. Participation in K12 educational robotics is a common foundation to enrollment in engineering majors, however the gender gap in traditional K12 robotics perpetuates the gender disparity. We hypothesize that soft robotics is a field that may promote interest in robotics and appeal to young female students’ enthusiasm for bioengineering and healthcare applications of engineering. Our previous work has focused on middle and high school curricula. However, after having the opportunity to bring our soft robotics curriculum to even younger students, we thought critically about project design and ease of implementation for this age group. Perceptions of who can participate in engineering are formed as early as elementary school for some students. We piloted a soft-robotics activity over three one-hour meetings with an elementary-aged Girl Scout troop where participants earned three Daisy Girl Scout Robotics badges. To assess perceptions of robotics, we developed the Draw a Robot Task (DART) from previous Draw a Scientist Tests and Draw an Engineer Tests to better understand children’s perception of robots and those who build robots. The survey includes the prompts \"Draw a robot.\" And \"Draw someone building a robot\". We present results from survey responses from the Girl Scout participants conducted before and after their exposure to soft robotics. Surveys captured the students’ drawings and perceptions of robotics and who builds robots. Survey responses and development of a validated measure will inform the use of soft robotics in grades as early as elementary school. We aim to evaluate an alternative robotics curriculum that is specifically designed to create inclusive robotics spaces for female students with the goal of reducing the gender disparity in STEM and traditional engineering majors.",

      "title": "Scaling up the SIMPLE Design Model for Faculty Development: Lessons Learned",
      "abstract": "This NSF DUE-funded project has supported the scaling and study of the SIMPLE model for faculty teaching development. The SIMPLE model provides a framework for ongoing teaching development in discipline-specific peer groups (SIMPLE groups) designed to support instructors as they learn about and try new research-supported interactive teaching strategies. Over the life of the project, SIMPLE groups have been active in six STEM departments at a large public research university. Studying the implementations in these six departments provided an opportunity to identify lessons learned for best practices in creation, leadership, and support of ongoing teaching development groups. This paper describes the lessons learned through this project and data that support them. Background and Motivation While existing literature supports the value of active and student-centered teaching practices for improving learning, retention, and engagement in post-secondary education, adoption of these practices has been slow in STEM disciplines [1, 2]. The primary goal of this NSF WIDER project was to study the impact of discipline-based faculty learning community model for teaching professional development. The SIMPLE model, which is described in further detail below, provides a structure for ongoing faculty-led teaching development. Designed to be adaptable and require little in the way of infrastructure, the SIMPLE model supports faculty as they learn about, implement, and revise evidence-based teaching strategies. Broadly speaking, these teaching strategies may be characterized as active, inquiry-based, and student/learnercentered. SIMPLE groups meet on a regular basis over at least one academic year to become familiar with new teaching strategies and to receive support and feedback as they work to innovate in their own teaching. The structure of the SIMPLE model is motivated by literature on professional development in K12 and higher education, as well as by literature about faculty learning communities [3]. In particular, the model of an ongoing faculty development community to which participants bring their own challenges has been demonstrated to be effective in K-12 spaces [4]. Ongoing professional development (rather than a one-time intervention) has been shown to improve sustained impact in higher education [5, 6]. The guiding principles of the SIMPLE model, which were identified based on the results of a preliminary NSF project that studied STEM teaching development groups [7], are as follows: ● Sustainable -Groups are small (typically 4-6 people) to reduce logistical challenges and have low (or no) infrastructure costs and low barriers to entry, thereby facilitating longterm sustainability. ● Incremental change -Participants are encouraged to undertake small, manageable changes in their teaching rather than engaging in a full overhaul their approach. The model emphasizes that a series of small changes leads to larger, sustainable change. ● Mentoring -Groups are designed to provide mentoring from a group leader who has experience with student-centered teaching, as well as to encourage peer feedback and support across group members. ● People driven -Participants bring their own teaching challenges to the group and identify potential ways to address those challenges from a menu of options introduced and discussed by the group. ● Learning Environments -The teaching development emphasizes active and studentcentered teaching and learning while remaining open to the wide range of strategies that fall within that category.",

      "abstract": "Implementing the K12 program in the Philippines introduced senior high school, bringing about significant changes in the education system, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. This reform aimed to align the Philippine educational system with international standards, enhance the quality of education, and prepare students for higher education. This study investigated the challenges senior high school teachers face during in-person learning in a specific school in Victoria City for the Academic Year 2022-2023. Data for this descriptive study was collected from 72 teachers using a self-made questionnaire that passed the rigorous validity and reliability test. The following areas were considered to have many problems: workload, teaching and learning resources, training and support, curriculum implementation, and student attitude. The results showed a significant difference in workload when grouped according to sex. For track handled student attitude has a significant difference, for length of service student attitude has a significant difference. For track-handled student attitude, there is a considerable difference. For length of service, student attitude has a significant difference. The result of the study calls for targeted interventions such as streamlining administrative tasks, specialized training programs, positive reinforcement initiatives, increased funding for resources, mentorship programs, and age-specific professional development, aiming to alleviate burdens, enhance teaching effectiveness, and foster a collaborative learning environment for sustainable improvements in senior high school education.

      "title": "Creating Meaningful Partnerships: Connecting Teaching Candidates with Professional Development Schools through Service Learning.",
      "abstract": "Through the use of constructed narratives, this article shares the experiences of two preservice teachers and their university professor in implementing service learning projects that took place within their Professional Development School partnerships. Findings suggest that (1) service learning was a valuable instructional strategy to enhance the PDS model. (2) The embedded structures within the PDS partnership were beneficial in helping to create a successful service learning projects. (3) The service learning projects required the preservice teachers to engage in their PDS in new and meaningful ways that further supported preservice teacher learning. Recommendations for teacher educators who want to incorporate service learning include using the existing structures of their school university partnerships to support the implementation of service learning, create service learning projects that directly align with the partnership’s School Improvement Plan, and establish clearly defined learning goals before preservice teachers engage in service learning to support their learning. NAPDS Essentials Addressed: #1/A comprehensive mission that is broader in its outreach and scope than the mission of any partner and that furthers the education profession and its responsibility to advance equity within schools and, by potential extension, the broader community; #2/A school–university culture committed to the preparation of future educators that embraces their active engagement in the school community Service learning has gained momentum as a valuable component of teacher education preparation (Erickson & Anderson, 1997). This article reflects the experiences of trying to implement service learning within a middle childhood program that is connected with four Professional Development School (PDS) partnerships. According to the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (2001), ‘‘professional development schools are innovative institutions formed through partnerships between professional education programs and P-12 schools. Their mission is professional preparation of candidates, faculty development, inquiry directed at the improvement of practice, and enhanced student learning’’ (p. 1). Through the use of constructed narratives, this article shares the experiences of two preservice teachers, Robin and Cortney, and their university professor, Lisa, in implementing service learning projects that were embedded in a middle childhood method’s course. The narratives explore the progression of the service learning project from conception to implementation and ending with individual reflections on their experiences. The article concludes with a discussion on the potential value that service learning offers in preparing preservice teachers while supporting K12 students, schools and communities.",

      "title": "Alaskan Professional Development: Lone Eagles Learn to \"Teach from Any Beach!\"",
      "abstract": "Galena, Alaska is a Native Alaskan village of 300 persons on the banks of the Yukon River, hundreds of miles from the nearest road system. Last year, the Galena City School district announced a K-12 correspondence program, Interior Distance Education for Alaska (IDEA), offering loaner computers and an annual subscription to the Internet. Three thousand students signed up from all over Alaska, representing 1,700 families, suddenly making the Galena school district (www.galenaalaska.org) the seventh largest school district in the state. One hundred and sixteen teachers were hired to assist these home schooling students in a program of online mentorship and brokerage of the best Internet learning resources available. Last December, the Alaska Staff Development Network (www.asdn.schoolzone.net/asdn/) hosted a leadership retreat titled \"Online Learning: Implications for School Leaders,\" where many of the administrators who lost students to Galena attended. Discussions were held on the viability of creating a district's own online courses, or brokering the best of what's already available. With limited access to the Internet at school, where students spend 19% of their time, the enthusiasm for a modern multimedia computer and home-based Internet access 100% of the time was understandable. There was no debate as to whether the benefit to students should come first. This year, many more Alaskan school districts are offering families a computer and local Internet access. At issue is which districts can make the claim of offering better mentorship, better resource brokerage, and a higher vision of what is most significant for students to learn. No less than the best of the best can be made available. In order to keep their students and their jobs, teachers now are challenged to learn how to locate and integrate the best Internet resources, project-based learning activities, existing courses, lesson plans and tutorials into their curriculum, which must also meet new Alaskan standards. Ongoing online professional development may be the best way to meet this challenge. Optimal strategies are being explored. Encouraging Hi-Tech Learning Galena Superintendent Carl Knudsen, a visionary from Montana, helped instigate a number of successful grant efforts that resulted in Internet access via satellite for the 11 Native Alaskan villages of the Yukon-Koyukuk Regional Consortium. Within 14 months, three Internet workshops per village were conducted. Each village now has a school Web page, digital cameras, and Internet access to unlimited learning resources. Three village schools are already involved with streaming video technologies. The workshops featured hands-on access to digital cameras, photo manipulation software (Adobe Photoshop,) multiple Web authoring programs, art tablets and high-end art software (Painter 5.0), creation of 3D object images for marketing native crafts, and the use of MIDI musical keyboards with tremendous capabilities costing only $225 (Yamaha PSR 225 from www.musiciansfriend.com). In Bettles, Alaska (population 30) students mentor students with the very latest technologies. Ramona, a Native Alaskan, has natural artistic ability and books of wonderful drawings using the available technology of the past, a pencil and paper. Today, Ramona has access to a digital arts tablet, Web authoring software, photo manipulation software and many state-of-the-art graphics software programs. Ramona can now self-publish her artwork globally. The Alaska Staff Development Network and the University of Alaska, Anchorage are offering nationally a series of online graduate level courses for teachers which include the following: 1) Making the Best Use of Internet for K12 Instruction. A hands-on course on how to broker the best resources for your classroom. 2) Designing Online Curriculum for K-12 Instruction. A hands-on course on how to easily create Internet hotlists, Web-tours, lesson plans, project-based learning activities (Webquest, Cyberfair, Thinkquest, etc. …",

      "abstract": "Special education teacher employment began to decline in 2006, concurrent with increased paraprofessional employment. At the same time, the prevalence of students with disabilities in several categories changed substantially, and the proportion of students being served in general education settings increased as well. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the decline in special education teacher employment was related to increased paraprofessional employment, and if the increase in paraprofessional employment was related to shifts in the composition of students with disabilities, educational placements, or more general state-level factors. We created a panel dataset for 2006–2015 and analyzed these relationships using a two-way fixed effects model. We found that, although changes in paraprofessional employment were unrelated to changes in special educator employment, they were related to changes in the prevalence of students with autism spectrum disorder. In addition, states with larger populations and higher K12 expenditures employed more paraprofessionals.",

      "abstract": "A rapid sample treatment procedure for the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) determination of anabolic steroids in human urine has been developed. The new procedure makes use of ultrasonic energy to reduce reaction times and increase the overall sensitivity. The following variables affecting the performance of the ultrasonic treatment were optimised: (i) time, (ii) device, (iii) frequency, and (iv) temperature. It was found that, under an ultrasonic field, the hydrolysis of conjugated steroids with beta-glucuronidase from Escherichia coli K12 was possible with a treatment time of 10 min. The accuracy and precision of the ultrasonic method were found to be in agreement with those achieved with the conventional thermal conductivity procedure (Student's t-test; p = 0.05, n = 10). After the enzymatic hydrolysis, the derivatisation of the target compounds with trimethylsilyl (TMS) reagent, methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA)/NH(4)I/dithioerythritol (DTE) (1000:2:4, v/w/w), was also accelerated using ultrasonic energy. In order to test the applicability of the use of ultrasonic energy in the acceleration of the derivatisation reaction with TMS, the classic method of thermal conductivity was applied for comparative purposes to a pool of 35 androgenic anabolic steroids (AAS) and/or their metabolites. The results demonstrated that after 3 min of sonication in a Sonoreactor device (50% amplitude), 19 of the 35 compounds studied showed similar reaction yield to those obtained with the classic procedure requiring 30 min (Student's t-test; p = 0.05, n = 5); 13 increased to higher silylation yields; and for the steroids 1-testosterone, danazol and etiocholanolone-D5, the same results were obtained using a sonication time of 5 min.The overall applicability of the ultrasonic-based sample treatment method is shown by the analysis of five urine samples. The results are similar to those achieved by the routine procedure. The new method is fast, robust, and allows high sample throughput.",

      "abstract": "The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) requires states to establish goals for all students and for groups of students characterized by race, ethnicity, poverty, disability, and limited English proficiency and requires schools to make annual progress in meeting these goals. In a number of states, officials have argued that increased federal education funding is not sufficient to cover the costs imposed by the new legislation. In this article, we use data from Texas to estimate the additional costs of meeting the new student performance standards. We find that these costs substantially exceed the additional federal funding. The article concludes with a discussion of whether NCLB should be considered an underfunded federal mandate and a brief discussion of the appropriate federal role in the financing of K12 education.",

      "abstract": "USING LIVE MODELING TO TRAIN PRESERVICE TEACHERS TO INTEGRATE TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR TEACHING Richard E. West Department of Instructional Psychology and Technology Master of Science Many researchers feel that teacher preparation programs are not doing enough to prepare teachers to effectively use technology. The result is a plethora of teachers who may know the basic functions of different programs, but who are unprepared to integrate these skills into their teaching. One method used by a few preservice programs, including BYU’s, is the use of modeling sessions, otherwise referred to as live modeling. In these modeling sessions, the instructor models for the preservice teachers how a K-12 teacher could teach with technology, while the preservice teachers participate as if they were K12 students. This thesis is a qualitative investigation of how this method of live modeling has impacted students, according to the perceptions of a sample of former students of the course. This project also has a practical focus of identifying strategies for improving modeling, and pitfalls that may indicate when modeling is not as effective. Overall, this study found that modeling was perceived by most students to be effective at teaching technology skills and ideas for integrating technology as teachers.",

      "abstract": "With increased interest in the use of virtual avatars for educational purposes, there is a growing need for high-quality text-to-speech solutions. However, the effects of using synthesized speech in educational applications for younger listeners are still unclear as past findings have been inconsistent and most of them have been obtained in a lab setting with adult assessors. Next to that, it is unclear how much training material is needed for high quality speech synthesis. Particularly for low resource languages, the assumption that good quality synthesized speech requires substantial amounts of vocal recordings to train may be hindering the development of TTS-based solutions. In this study, we created four Dutch text-to-speech (TTS) models from different amounts of training material and evaluated the models in terms of voice perception and recall with K12 students in a classroom environment. Results showed that while the original human voice outperformed the synthesized voices in terms of the listening experience and knowledge test score, more hours of training material did not necessarily result in better outcomes suggesting that 10-15 hours of speech material might be sufficient for training a Dutch TTS. A weak positive correlation was found between listening experience and knowledge test performance, with the low listening effort being the most important factor. This outcome suggests that comprehensibility is likely the most important TTS feature for educational applications.",

The abstract is used on the ASEE website, program materials, and other K-12 Workshop promotional activities. Participants of this workshop will engage in activities from a project-based engineering curriculum by discussing how a class can plan and carry out an experiment to identify optimal solutions to a stated engineering problem, analyzing a provided data set from such an activity, and discussing tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy. Following the activity, participants will divide into groups to explore alignment with different sets of standards, including Next Generation Science Standards and Common Core State Standards in both English/Language Arts and Mathematics. Groups will report their results and discuss implications for making such connections in their own curricula. Workshop Description.

Sheraton Seattle | Seattle | WA 2015-ASEE-K12-Proposal-Form_Engineer Your World_Hands-On Standards.docx Page 3 of 5 Learning Objectives: Learning objectives may be divided into two categories: (1) engineering content, skills and practices; and (2) alignment across different sets of standards. In the former category, participants will learn about design of experiments, data analysis and interpretation, using computational and mathematical models as evidence to argue for a proposed solution, and tradeoffs. In the latter category, participants will practice aligning an engineering activity to multiple sets of standards, and will explore opportunities to create such connections in their own curricula. Agenda and Hands-on Activities: Introduction (10 min) – UTeachEngineering is a program at The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) that aims to create leaders in secondary engineering education. Design skills are important for future engineers and non-engineers alike, and this belief has fueled UTeachEngineering to develop Engineer Your World, a scaffolded, researchbased high school course centered on the engineering design process. The contents of this workshop are based on this course. The Design of Experiments (15 minutes) [Discussion] – Participants will view a video introducing the activity. They will then discuss how to design the experiment and explore challenges with this approach in the classroom. The Data Analysis (15 minutes) [Hands-on Activity] – Participants will analyze a provided data set and discuss how students are required to use computational and mathematical models as evidence to argue for a proposed solution Since multiple correct solutions exist, participants must consider tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy. The Standards Alignment (20 min) [Hands-on Activity] – Participants will work in small groups, with each group aligning the activity to a different set of standards (e.g., NGSS, CCSS). Groups will share out results. Making Connections in Your Curricula (15 min) – Participants will work together to identify opportunities for making such cross-standards connections in their own curricula. Materials for Participants to Take: Participants will leave the workshop with knowledge of engineering skills and practices as well as ideas for making cross-standards connections in their existing curricula. Additionally, they will leave with information about implementation support available to schools interesting in adopting the Engineer Your World program. Practical Applications: Teachers, administrators and outreach staff can use the engineering skills in their own work. Teachers and administrators can use the experience to identify opportunities to bundle standards in their own curricula.

Identify and describe how you will explicitly address the ways in which your lesson or activity is representative of the processes, habits of mind and practices used by engineers, or is demonstrative of work in specific engineering fields. i At least one of those must be within the first four listed, below; i.e., do not only check “other”. Check all that apply: Use of an engineering design process that has at least one iteration/improvement X Attention to specific engineering habits of mind X Attention to engineering practices (as described in the NGSS/Framework and as practiced by engineers) Attention to specific engineering careers or fields related to the lesson/activity Other (please describe below) Provide a description of how you will explicitly address these aspects of authentic engineering in your workshop (maximum 2,000 characters): Engineering Habits of Mind and Practices: Participants will engage in design of experiments (how to design an three-factor experiment to gather data to brew the perfect cup of coffee), data analysis and interpretation (given a data set, how can one represent and interpret the data), the use of computational and mathematical models as evidence to argue for a proposed solution (to argue for their own chosen solution to the challenge), and an analysis of tradeoffs (to decide between multiple “right” solutions). These are all engineering practices or habits of mind. Diversity. This year is the American Society for Engineering Education’s “Year of Action on Diversity.” It is essential that we have a diverse engineering workforce to solve diverse problems. To do that and to have an engineering-literate public, it is essential that we reach every preK-12 student with high-quality engineering education, drawing on issues of access and equity in the classroom and in the curriculum. Reviewers would like to know how your proposed workshop will address diversity. Provide a description of how you will explicitly address diversity – e.g., diversity with respect to gender/sex, ethnicity or race, special education inclusion, socio-economic status, or LGBT status – in your workshop (maximum 2,000 characters): This activity is taught successfully to 3300 students in Engineer Your World classrooms at 77 schools. Among these, 28 percent are female, nine percent are Black, and 42 percent are Hispanic/Latino(a). The curriculum was designed expressly to engage underrepresented students in engineering.

      "title": "Response to Intervention Models as Alternatives to Traditional Views of Learning Disabilities: Response to the Commentaries",
      "abstract": "Three commentaries, by Torgesen, Fuchs and Fuchs, and Reynolds and Shaywitz, differ in their approach to our article on response to intervention (RTI). Torgesen provides data on the results of the statewide implementation of the Reading First early reading program in Florida, showing that this version of an RTI model resulted in higher reading achievement and a reduction in the special education eligibility rate. On a smaller scale, many districts that implemented RTI models have reported similar outcomes (Jimerson, Burns, & VanDerHeyden, 2007). Fuchs and Fuchs concur with our depiction of RTI and its evidence base, with one exception: they propose standardized implementation approaches, describing a three-tier model that parallels our depiction of one approach to RTI. Although the standardized model has a strong research base, including our work, we are less interested in promoting a unitary model that includes standardized, individualized, or problem-solving approaches to implementation as long as schools use ongoing student data to inform decisions. Also, many districts will be slow to equate special education with Tier 3, partly because of due process issues. We may not agree with Fuchs, Fuchs, and Torgesen on some issues about RTI, but we do not disagree that these approaches are associated with positive outcomes for students at risk for academic and behavioral problems and that the data generated from multi-tiered interventions can enhance decision making on behalf of students. \n \nReynolds and Shaywitz express traditional views of learning disabilities (LDs) that we believe are outdated and unsupported by research. Despite their appeal to evidence, their citation list is mostly not peer reviewed. This is not surprising because there is little data supporting their views. Their depiction of the state of the evidence on RTI is not accurate, and these models of service delivery are being implemented for good reasons (Spectrum K12 Solutions/The Council of Administrators on Special Education, 2008), many of which are outlined in our original paper. \n \nAs they observe, most of the issues that emerge when RTI data are used for identification also apply to the traditional model they support: “While there are well-known problems associated with current methods, there is little evidence that RTI methods are any better” (p. X). After thirty years of implementation, psychometric methods of identification are still associated with problems that, as we observed, would affect the use of RTI methods if identification relied on instructional response data as a sole criterion and with a rigid cut point. In fact, no single method is sufficient, and we proposed potential solutions to psychometric problems affecting identification. \n \nData are available for two of their areas of concern. They are mostly null and unsupportive of their propositions, but uncited by Reynolds and Shaywitz. First are “bright” students: despite their passionate advocacy for these students, they neglect to indicate who they are and how to identify them. If IQ is the measure of aptitude, a regression-corrected discrepancy in different academic domains may be meaningful for students in the upper ranges of IQ, but high IQ and lower achievement is often a regression artifact (Reynolds, 1984–1985). If IQ and achievement correlate at .58, a 1.5 standard error discrepancy would require achievement to be about 32 points lower than IQ at IQ levels of 130 (Fletcher et al., 1994). In this study, less than 5% of the sample identified as LD in reading using multiple psychometric definitions had reading achievement above the 25th percentile. It is impossible to determine whether any student is disabled solely on the basis of his or her IQ level. Finally, as we indicated in our paper, cutting a normal distribution to identify LDs is inherently arbitrary because they represent dimensional disorders. \n \nWe are not saying that “bright” students with LD do not exist; IQ per se does not demarcate LD, just as poor instructional response per se does not indicate LD. Thus, our failure to support their traditional notion of LD—”the core concept has been unexpected achievement levels in relation to ability” (p. X)—is not mischievous, but deliberate. Reynolds and Shaywitz say “bright students … share many qualities … with lower functioning, struggling readers” (p. X), but the point of the two meta-analyses is that IQ referencing does not differentiate these two groups on phonological processing even though their IQ levels are about a standard deviation different (Hoskyn & Swanson, 2000; Stuebing et al., 2002). In a meta-analysis of 22 studies, Stuebing et al. (in press) found that IQ accounted for about 1% of the unique variance in response to reading interventions. \n \nThese concerns lead to the second issue: what other criteria are needed to identify LDs? We argue for instructional response as a central inclusionary criterion; Reynolds and Shaywitz view instructional response as secondary and exclusionary, advocating instead for assessments of cognitive processes. They cite no data supporting their belief that a student’s cognitive profile permits “the derivation of different and more effective instruction” (p. X), and we cannot identify such data (Fletcher et al., 2007). We are not saying that LD is not correlated with specific cognitive skills—only that if achievement is measured, their contribution to intervention or identification is not practically significant. It is incumbent on advocates like Reynolds and Shaywitz to provide data that justifies the focus on eligibility instead of intervention in schools and the expense of extensive assessments of IQ and cognitive processes. \n \nAn appropriately implemented RTI model will include a comprehensive assessment with measures derived from the hybrid model we described (see Fletcher et al., 2007). It will assess achievement comprehensively, and thus will not miss students “whose phonological skills have been remediated … and who continue to struggle to read fluently and with comprehension” (p. X). Perhaps the best approach to identifying “bright” children with LD is to examine discrepancies in achievement levels, which may indicate a need for intervention. \n \nWe indicated that IDEA 2004 requires a comprehensive evaluation and permits referral of a child at any point in the RTI process. IDEA states that students should not be identified solely on the basis of one criterion, and that the team responsible for determining eligibility can use whatever tests they deem relevant, including IQ tests. However, if there is sufficient concern to warrant intervention, the student should have had appropriate instruction before being identified as having a disability, regardless of IQ level. How else is low achievement unexpected and indicative of disability in the absence of inadequate instructional response, which is necessary, but not sufficient? \n \nWe did not suggest that implementing RTI approaches is easy, that adequate personnel exist everywhere, or that implementation will be without considerable challenges. We support RTI approaches because they integrate the best evidence we have about how to effectively provide services for students at risk for or with disabilities involving academic and behavioral problems. When Public Law-94-142 was passed in 1975, we knew little about implementing individualized education plans, nor did we have adequate personnel for developing educational programs and teaching students with disabilities in public schools. However, this precursor to IDEA 2004 was a groundbreaking pronouncement about the value of educating all children in public schools. The evidence supporting RTI approaches provides a framework for service delivery and data-based decision making using the best scientific research available to prevent and remediate academic difficulties and to facilitate identification and treatment of those with disabilities.",

      "title": "Building Measurement Devices with Students – From Hands-on to Minds-on",
      "abstract": "Although the teaching of mechanics at advanced K12 levels often starts with a brief introduction to physical quantities and units, the nature and function of measurements in physics and their inherent uncertainty are hardly ever discussed. The laboratory is mainly used to illustrate the theoretical principles taught in class. This paper presents a project-based learning approach that aims to provide high school students with a sense of the nature and role of measurements in physics (units, uncertainty, etc.) as well as help them develop laboratory, data analysis, and scientific communication skills in a fun and engaging way. Each project involves the design, building, and calibration of a measurement device for a basic physical quantity (time, length, and mass). Each measurement device is made up of recycled materials (e.g., plastic bottles) and simple pieces of equipment available in any high school physics laboratory (e.g., springs). The students build the device, calibrate it, and write a detailed documentation that explains how it works, its specifications, and instructions for use. The students also present their work to peers and visitors. We describe five basic measurement devices, the scaffolding we used to help the students make the transition from the “arts and crafts” aspect of the work to its deeper scientific meaning, and different orchestrations for various classroom settings.",

      "title": "Predictive Student Modelling in an Online Reading Platform",
      "abstract": "Use of technology-enhanced education and online learning systems has become more popular, especially after COVID-19. These systems capture a rich array of data as students interact with them. Predicting student performance is an essential part of technology-enhanced education systems to enable the generation of hints and provide recommendations to students. Typically, this is done through use of data on student interactions with questions without utilizing important data on the temporal ordering of students’ other interaction behavior, (e.g., reading, video watching). In this paper, we hypothesize that to predict students’ question performance, it is necessary to (i) consider other learning activities beyond question-answering and (ii) understand how these activities are related to question-solving behavior. We collected middle school physical science students’ data within a K12 reading platform, Actively Learn. This platform provides reading-support to students and collects trace data on their use of the system. We propose a transformer-based model to predict students' question scores utilizing question interaction and reading-related behaviors. Our findings show that integrating question attempts and reading-related behaviors results in better predictive power compared to using only question attempt features. The interpretable visualization of the transformer’s attention can be helpful for teachers to make tailored interventions in students’ learning.",

      "title": "A review of AWE feedback: types, learning outcomes, and implications",
      "abstract": "Abstract Automated writing evaluation (AWE) plays an important role in writing pedagogy and has received considerable research attention recently; however, few reviews have been conducted to systematically analyze the recent publications arising from the many studies in this area. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the literature on AWE feedback for writing in terms of methodology, types of learners, types of feedback and its applications, learning outcomes, and implications. A total of 48 articles from Social Science Citation Index journals and four other important journals in the field of language education were collected and analyzed. The findings revealed that most previous studies on AWE applied quantitative research methods, rather than purely qualitative ones. The duration of the experiments in approximately 33% of the studies was shorter than ten weeks, and 10% of the studies were of one session only. The group size of over half of the studies had fewer than 30 participants, and 21% of the studies had medium to large group sizes (from 51 to 100). The focus of most of the articles was on L2 writers with little attention paid to L1 writers and K12 students. AWE feedback to some extent can improve students’ writing from the product-oriented aspect but is not as effective as human feedback (e.g. teacher or peer feedback). Students generally considered AWE feedback useful and were motivated when using it, although they noticed a lack of accuracy and explicitness as the feedback tended to be generic and formulaic. The results of the review have several implications for researchers, teachers, and developers of AWE systems.",
