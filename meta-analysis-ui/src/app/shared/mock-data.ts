        "title": "E-Learning Consequences of the Declining Interest in Engineering Studies in Europe",
        "abstract": "The success of e-learning in a specific country is based on the number of computer science experts involved in the same geographic area. As a fact, the entire development of an e-learning infrastructure depends on the persons who have the expertise to create and maintain e-materials. Unfortunately, in 2006 official European statistics on education (see Eurostat 2007) showed that the interest in computer science and engineering fields of study had decreased each year, attesting to a decline in interest among K12 students for these careers, thus potentially affecting e-learning progress. This paper aims to illustrate the importance of the declining number of engineering experts in Europe and the possible consequences in the e-learning field if this decline persists. It will also identify similar consequences which have already occurred in other industrialised countries such as Canada and United States (see Computer Research Policy 2007).",

        "title": "Organizational Agility in Educational Setting: A Case Study of Sekolah Murid Merdeka",
        "abstract": "Agility becomes the most significant dimension in facing the Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity (VUCA) situation. Schools as a key organisation in surviving any environment changes need to adapt and adjust. On the other hand, schools are viewed as conventional institutions. Comfortable with a traditional approach in managing the organization, schools consider as one of the latter in implementing change management. Lack of discussion and research related to agility in schools, particularly kindergarten to high school (K12) setting encourage this article to conduct a case study in one of the fastest growing schools in Indonesia namely Sekolah Murid Merdeka (SMM). This article was conducted using a qualitative method complemented with a survey as triangulation approach. The result from this research is that SMM argues to be implementing agility as a key variable in executing the operational system. Agility became a significant dimension in helping SMM adjust with the current environment and market demand thus resulted in gaining almost 10000 students in one year.",

        "abstract": "• Victor Valley College RamPage • vvcrampage@gmail.com • issuu.com/vvcrampage • vvc.edu/offices/rampage • Features pg. 4 Sports pg. 20 News pg. 2 Opinion pg. 19 The California Community Colleges Board of Governors (CCCBG) has released the results of a six year study conducted on the state’s 112 community colleges students and their students. Beginning in 2006, and through the spring of 2012, the CCCBG tracked the progress of all Victor Valley College students who enrolled at VVC in that time frame. Statistics show that only 38.6 percent of those students went on to complete either a degree or transfer outcome. Students who entered VVC after meeting UC transferable pre-requisite scores on their assessment had a 73.1 percent of obtaining a degree or transfer status. Those who scored for placement in remedial courses went on to complete their degree or transfer status 35.6 percent of the time. “I've been teaching here 12 years, and every year, my students come to freshman composition less prepared,” said English Professor Bruce Wolcott. The statistics show that many students are not prepared for the basic requirements that are needed for making the transition into college. For the students who score below requisite level, remedial courses must be taken before the student can advance to college level courses. Remedial courses do not provide acceptable UC transferrable or degree level credits. “According to the master plan of the Community Colleges Board of Governors, community colleges were designed to be open to everybody,” said Tim Johnston, Doctor of education. Easy enrollment accessibility weighs heavy on the resources of the college and due to insufficient funds, the college is unable to provide preparation tools for every person who plans to enroll at VVC. The college is initiating programs within a network of 23 participating high-schools to help prepare students for making the transition into the next level of education. The Victor Valley Student Success Committee, in partnership with the K12 Bridge program are taking steps toward improving assessment scores at the high-school level. They are initiating 'interventions' which Approximately 200 classes have been added to the summer schedule to better accommodate the student needs at Victor Valley College. The new schedule will not be posted on WebAdvisor until May 1. “With feed-back from students about the need for class, the enrollment management committee asked the Department Chairs and Deans to add to the summer schedule,” said Peter Allan, Interim Executive Vice President. With more available classes, graduating VVC students benefit from the increased courses. The incoming high school students who are looking to get ahead in college courses are also able to take advantage of the newly added classes. “The addition of these classes will allow High School students to enroll in College level classes which will count towards their High School graduation, and give them an opportunity to enroll in classes in the Fall semester,” said Allan. With the availability of classes, many students can thrive from the added courses. A large portion of students wanting to enroll in summer session were discouraged due to the lack of variety.

        "title": "AC 2012-4321: CREATING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES IN THE K12 CLASSROOM: AN INITIAL SURVEY OF THE FIELD",
        "abstract": "The recently released Framework for K-12 Science Education Standards emphasizes the importance of science and engineering practices to the K-12 classroom. This continues the stress on process and authentic activities that has characterized science education reform over at least the last two decades . It also adds the more explicit inclusion of engineering that has characterized more recent efforts. However, creating these experiences in the classroom is far from trivial. Much of the work looking at the specific structure of such inquiry-based activities at the K-12 level has consisted of either articulating intended goals or rubrics for assessing the degree of inquiry learning. This paper is intended to illuminate the means for achieving those goals and levels by generating a taxonomy of different pedagogical structures used for inquiry activities. We aim to articulate structures that are more general than individual lessons but more specific than broad goals. By systematically reviewing over 300 activities across a variety of curriculum sources, content areas and grade bands, we have validated a set of eight inquiry activity structures: Protocol, Design Challenge, Product Testing, Black Box, Discrepant Event, Intrinsic Data Space, Taxonomy, And Modeling. We further explore how particular structures are better suited to emphasizing engineering in the K12 classroom, and assess the adequacy of engineering practice exercises across subject areas and grade bands. We found the prevalence of activities that included engineering practices to lag behind the prevalence of those including science practices. However, the dominant activity structure including engineering practices – the Design Challenge – was also far better at other activity structures at promoting inquiry-based learning. Promoting inquiry-based teaching has become the central focus of reform in science education for more than two decade. That is, there is a need to move instruction from traditional teaching, where the teacher and text acts as the source of clear, unchanging information to inquiry learning, where students are active constructors of knowledge, work with data and support conclusions with empirical warrants. This was a central feature of the original National Science Education Standards . The new Framework for K-12 Science Standards continues this call, making both the importance of process and the relevance of engineering more explicit. Making this goal a reality, however, has not been easy. The interest in promoting inquiry-based teaching has certainly generated actual instances of inquiry-based instruction specific curricula and instructional plans. These have limits, though, as specific examples rather than broader concepts. In reviewing the state of inquiry as an organizing theme of science education, Anderson stresses “teachers have to be the focal point of a move towards more inquiry-oriented science education”. Our concern, therefore, lies with what conceptual resources have been provided to support teachers in enacting inquiry. At the other end of the spectrum from specific instructional plans, well articulated, abstract goals have been established. Those embedded in the various standards documents are prime examples. But these are aspirational, rather than prescriptive. Our objective is to provide teachers tools that are more general than specific activities, but more concrete that aspirational goals. As part of this goal, we aim to produce a taxonomy of the various pedagogical strategies behind creating experiences with science and engineering practices in the K-12 classroom. In this study, we have reviewed over 300 K-12 science activities from a variety of curricular resources. We have generated and validated a categorization of the structure of these lessons. In addition, by analyzing other aspects of each activity, we highlight several issues with the current state of inquiry learning in general, and engineering education specifically. Nomenclature Before proceeding further, there is an issue of nomenclature to deal with. The new Framework for Science Education does two things to improve terminology. By using the phrase “science and engineering practices” it makes clear the importance of inquiry as a reflection of what scientists and engineers do, not just inquiry as a pedagogical strategy. Second, it explicitly includes engineering, thereby stressing its importance and telegraphing that there are some differences between science and engineering. What is lacking, however, in the Standards documents and the field at large, are umbrella terms for science and engineering, and scientific inquiry and engineering design. There is no doubt that there are important distinctions, and separate terms are often needed. However, there are also important similarities, particularly in noting the difference between inquiry in a science or engineering context and inquiry in other fields such as history, art or literature. The new Framework makes this clear in that two of the eight practices distinguish between science and engineering, but six do not. At a more practical level, in K-12 education, to the extent that students are exposed to engineering, it is in the context of a class that is otherwise called “Science class”. Therefore, our use of the term “inquiry” here is intended in a broad manner. That is, it refers to the variety of investigative practices intended to expand our understanding of the natural and technological world. We mean to distinguish it from other forms of knowledge generation such as history, art or literature. Where we mean to distinguish within this category, we refer to scientific inquiry and engineering design. In our discussion of the work of others, we note their applicability to science and engineering. Likewise, when we refer to “science education”, “science class”, “science activities” etc. we are including engineering under the assumption that it is that part of the institution of K-12 education where experiences of engineering are likely to occur. Supporting Teachers in Conducting Inquiry The most obvious resources lie at the other end of the spectrum of abstraction from specific lesson plans. There are well-established articulations of what inquiry learning needs to include. Table 1 shows the essential features of classroom inquiry as delineated by the inquiry addendum to the National Science Education Standards. Essential Features of Classroom Inquiry 1) Learners are engaged by scientifically oriented questions. 2) Learners give priority to evidence, which allows them to develop and evaluate explanations that address scientifically oriented questions. 3) Learners formulate explanations from evidence to address scientifically oriented questions 4) Learners evaluate their explanations in light of alternative explanations, particularly those reflecting scientific understanding. 5) Learners communicate and justify their proposed explanations. Table 1 From Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards Though one could easily argue that these are incomplete with regard to engineering, any of these are certainly applicable to engineering. The new Framework for Science Education achieves more balanced coverage by delineating eight “science and engineering practices”, shown in Table 2 Science and Engineering Practices 1) Asking questions (for science) and defining problems (for engineering) 2) Developing and using models 3) Planning and carrying out investigations 4) Analyzing and interpreting data 5) Using mathematics and computational thinking 6) Constructing explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for engineering) 7) Engaging in argument from evidence 8) Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information Table 2 From the Framework for Science Education But these are aspirational goals: they define a target without necessarily providing guidance as to how to get there. Similarly, a number of rubrics have been developed for assessing the degree of inquiry in a given instance of instruction . Most are variants on the Herron Scale, where activities move up in levels as responsibility for conclusions, methods and questions move from teacher to student. These are applicable to both science and engineering contexts. While these can certainly play a role in guiding teacher practice through self-correction, they do not form conceptual resources for generating instruction. Level Problem Ways & Means Answers 0 Given Given Given 1 Given Given Open 2 Given Open Open 3 Open Open Open Table 3 The Herron Scale, take from Shulman and Tamir, based on Schwab and Herron Over the years there have been a number of approaches to defining inquiry for teachers, such as the Inquiry Cycle from White and colleagues or Kuhn and Pease set of ten skills. Bell and colleagues comprised a meta-list of categories used in prior frameworks. What ultimately limits these approaches is that they are not constructed from the point of view of teachers. Rather, they are based on descriptions of either what scientists do or what we want students to do. This means they retain an aspirational rather than guiding character. Consider Harwood’s description of his “activity model for scientific inquiry” as containing “10 activities in which scientists engage as often as necessary through the scientific process”. Similar to the Essential Features of Classroom Inquiry from the NSES, these often have the problem of failing to cover engineering adequately. But they also have a more basic shortcoming. Such a format tells teachers what they should get their students to do, not what teachers should do to get students to do it. Even the Herron Scale is constructed around what teachers should not do. This often instills a subtractive approach to developing inquiry: teachers plan the same underlying activity, but give less instruction. Difficulty in Inquiry Defining what teachers should do, or alternatively, the options available to them, is importan",

        "abstract": "Staff in a Kansas school district developed a survey consisting of a comprehensive set of technology integration indicators to provide data to be used in planning group and individual professional development related to the use of educational technology. Surveyed teachers rated themselves on \"where I am now\" and \"where I would like to be.\" After a pilot test, the revised survey was distributed to the district's teaching staff. Over 75% of the teaching staff responded at the first administration, and at the second administration 1,215 teachers completed the survey (90% response rate). Factor and reliability analyses indicated that the survey was a high-quality instrument that provided information that can be used to design relevant group and individual professional development and to monitor the development of teachers' technology integration skills.

With this expenditure of nearly $2400 per student, the school board and district administration wanted to enhance teachers' technology skills and to provide a system to monitor continuous improvement in technology use. Perspective A great deal of literature has expressed concern about teachers' lack of the skills needed to effectively integrate technology into the curriculum. For example, a recent survey by Market Data Retrieval (1999) found that 61 percent of teachers felt either \"not at all prepared\" or only \"somewhat prepared\" to integrate technology into classroom instruction. Further, the survey indicated that teachers with 11 or more hours of technology training were far more likely to use technology in the classroom than were teachers who received less training. Also supporting the importance of professional development to improve teachers' skills in the use of technology is research conducted in the Fairfax County Schools. White (1996) reported that students may have increased the frequency or effectiveness of their use of technology as a result of teacher training or in-class modeling by a specialist. In a recent journal article Becker (2000) also noted that \"How likely students are to experience computers in intellectually powerful ways depends greatly on their teacher's expertise with computers\" (p. 54). A report by the CEO Forum (2000) underscored the link between professional development and effective use of technology in the nation's classrooms when it stated: Well-trained teachers are the key to creating digital learning environments. Schools and districts must continue to make the commitment to professional development by providing the necessary support, resources and time for teachers to learn both how to use technology and, more importantly, how to integrate digital content and tools into the curriculum and instruction\" (p. 27).

But there are still some problems to think about such as: what students should learn before teaching, how they learn it, the effects of class preparation and so on. It is also important to know how and what teaching methods teachers should adopt in accordance with students learning. Lexue 100 has done deep study by analyzing the above-mentioned issues and worked out its own solutions.

It also shows the improvements in students’ basic knowledge, skills in solving problems and interests of learning. Some experimental data will be provided.
