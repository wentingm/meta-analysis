In this work, we present a novel active role-switching (ARS)\n","policy trained using reinforcement learning, in which the agent is rewarded for adapting its tutor\n","or tutee behavior to the child’s knowledge mastery level. To investigate how the three different\n","child–agent interaction paradigms (tutee, tutor, and peer agents) impact children’s learning\n","and affective engagement, we designed a randomized controlled between-subject experiment.\n","Fifty-nine children aged 5–7 years old from a local public school participated in a collaborative\n","word-learning activity with one of the three agent-role paradigms. Our analysis revealed that\n","children’s vocabulary acquisition benefited from the robot tutor’s instruction and knowledge\n","demonstration, whereas children exhibited slightly greater affect on their faces when the robot\n","behaves as a tutee of the child. This synergistic effect between tutor and tutee roles suggests\n","why our adaptive peer-like agent brought the most benefit to children’s vocabulary learning\n","and affective engagement, as compared to an agent that interacts only as a tutor or tutee for\n","the child. This work sheds light on how fixed role (tutor/tutee) and adaptive role (peer) agents\n","support children’s cognitive and emotional needs as they play and learn. It also contributes to\n","an important new dimension of designing educational agents — actively adapting roles based\n","on the student’s engagement and learning needs.\n","1. Introduction\n","Early childhood is a critical period of development that sets the foundation for children’s future academic success and aspiration.\n","Unfortunately, only about 30% of eligible 4-year-old children are enrolled in state pre-K programs every year (National Institute\n","of Early Education Research, 2018). Many young children do not have access to quality preschool programs or equivalent home\n","schooling, and consequently do not achieve kindergarten readiness prior to entering the formal education system (Nores & Barnett,\n","2014; U.S. Department of Education, 2015). Statistics show many children who start off below readiness level have hard time\n","catching up (Garcia & Weiss, 2017). Access to extracurricular support (e.g., after-school or summer programs) could help reduce\n","this gap, but resources are limited and can be very costly (Grossman, Lind, Hayes, McMaken, & Gersick, 2009).\n","∗Correspondence to: Media Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, E14-474, 75 Amherst St, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\n","E-mail addresses:\n","hchen25@media.mit.edu (H.
